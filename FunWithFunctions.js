/*I have written out the shells of some functions that you will have to create the logic for. a couple of tips:    

  1. Take your time. Think about each problem, and try to break it into its individual parts. 
     consider writing down these steps, and then try and convert them into code

  2. Run your code along the way. If you are getting strange outputs, use them to help figure out where you 
     are making your mistake. Make sure to test every function with multiple different inputs.

  3. Uncomment the function calls I have made for you at the bottom of the file in order to test your function. 
     make sure you are getting all of the expected results

// Function one: should have two parameters, meaning it will take two arguments. 
// Should add two numbers, and console.log the result.

const addTwoNumbers = function() {

  //Your code goes here

}


// Function Two: should have two parameters, meaning it will take two arguments. 
// Should multiply the two numbers, and console.log the result.

const multiplyTwoNumbers = function() {

  //Your code goes here

}


// Function Three: should have two parameters, meaning it will take two arguments. 
// Should divide the first argument by the second, and console.log the result.

const divideXByY = function() {

  //Your code goes here

}


// Function Four: should have two parameters, meaning it will take two arguments. 
// The first argument will be the total amount in dollars and cents (ex. 10.25) and the second will be the percentage of tax charged (ex. 5).
// calculate the toal price (the amount, + the percentage)

const calculateTax = function() {

  //Your code goes here

}
